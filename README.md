# Hi, I’m Sudharshan M 👋

I work best at the intersection of **data, logic, and real-world problems**.

I’m currently training myself to become a **Data Analyst** who doesn’t just generate charts—but understands *what the data is trying to say* and *why it matters* for decisions.

I’m not in a rush to label myself as an expert.  
I focus on **getting the fundamentals right** and building credibility through consistent work.

## 🧠 How I Think About Data

- Data is only useful if it leads to **clear decisions**
- Clean data matters more than fancy tools
- Good analysis is about asking **better questions**, not just writing code
- If I can’t explain an insight simply, I don’t consider it complete

---

## 🛠️ Skills I Actively Use

**Data Analysis**
- Python (Pandas, NumPy for data cleaning & exploration)
- SQL (joins, aggregations, subqueries)

**Visualization**
- Tableau  
- Power BI  

**Databases**
- MySQL  
- MongoDB  

**Programming Background**
- Java, C, C++

## 📌 What I’m Currently Working On

- Practicing SQL with real datasets instead of mock examples  
- Using Python to extract insights from messy, real-world data  
- Improving how I present insights so non-technical people understand them  
- Building small but meaningful analytics projects  

---

## 🎯 What I’m Looking For

- Data Analyst / Business Intelligence internships  
- Entry-level analytics roles  
- Projects where data is actually used to make decisions  

If the role involves **learning, ownership, and real data**, I’m interested.

*I value clarity over hype, consistency over shortcuts,  
and learning that actually compounds.*
