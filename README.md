# Hi, I’m Sudharshan M

I am a Student focused on developing practical skills in Data Analytics through consistent, hands-on work with datasets.

My current focus is on strengthening core analytics fundamentals-SQL, Python, and Data visualization-and applying them to structured problem statements rather than surface-level tool usage.

I approach data work with discipline and clarity, aiming to produce results that are accurate, understandable, and useful.
